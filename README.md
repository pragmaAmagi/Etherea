# Synergy Strategy Algorithm

## Project Overview
The Synergy Strategy Algorithm is a sophisticated community betting game that simulates complex interactions between players, incorporating elements of game theory, behavioral economics, and multi-agent systems. This project aims to model and analyze strategic decision-making in a community-driven betting environment. 

## Recent Updates (September 2024)
- Implemented a web-based interface using Flask for easier interaction with the game
- Enhanced the observer role mechanics, ensuring all observers are paid correctly
- Adjusted the payoff calculations to better reflect community alignment and disagreement scenarios
- Improved logging and debugging features for better game analysis
- Fixed issues with GitHub synchronization and repository management

## Key Features
- Multi-layer player system (base players, observers, and specialized roles)
- Dynamic payoff calculations based on various factors:
  - Community alignment
  - Prediction accuracy
  - Role-based bonuses
  - Reputation impact
- Web interface for game interaction and visualization
- Customizable game parameters for flexible simulation scenarios

## Project Structure
- `mathematical_model.py`: Core game logic and player classes
- `community_betting.py`: Game management and betting mechanics
- `app.py`: Flask web application for game interaction
- `simple_interface.py`: Command-line interface for game testing
- `model_analysis.py`: Tools for analyzing game outcomes and player strategies
- `nash_equilibrium_solver.py`: Utilities for finding Nash equilibria in game scenarios

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed
2. Install required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the Flask application: `python app.py`
4. Access the web interface at `http://localhost:5000`

## Game Mechanics
- Players are divided into layers with different roles (base players, observers, bank, odd setter, validator)
- Each round, players place bets and make predictions
- Payoffs are calculated based on prediction accuracy, community alignment, and role-specific bonuses
- The community score evolves based on overall betting behavior
- Player reputations and cumulative profits are updated after each round

## Future Developments
- Implement more sophisticated AI strategies for automated players
- Enhance the web interface with real-time updates and data visualization
- Introduce more complex betting scenarios and multi-round tournaments
- Develop a comprehensive API for external integrations

## Mathematical Proof

π_i(x_i, X_{-i}) = μ(X)/n - c_i(x_i) + (1-exp(-α * ∑_i x_i)) * x_i * ∑_{j≠i} (x_j / σ_j^2) / (∑_{k≠i} 1/σ_k^2)
Var[π_i] = σ^2(X)/n^2

Updated payoff function 08/18/2024:
π_i(x_i, X_{-i}) = μ(X)/n - c_i(x_i) + (1-exp(-α * ∑_i x_i)) * x_i * ∑_{j≠i} (x_j / σ_j^2) / (∑_{k≠i} 1/σ_k^2) - β * (μ(X) - x_i)^2

Variables:
π_i(xi, X{-i}): Payoff function for player i
xi: Strategy of player i 
X{-i}: Strategies of all players except i 
μ(X): Mean function of all strategies 
n: Number of players 
c_i(x_i): Cost function for player i 
α: A parameter to assess risk
σ_j: Standard deviation associated with player j

penalty_term(x_i, X) = β * (μ(X) - x_i)^2

β: Penalty coefficient
μ(X): Average bet of all players
x_i: Player i's bet

# Core Game:
• Two players
• 50/50 chance outcome (like a coin flip)
• 2x2 payoff matrix
• Non-zero sum (players can both gain or lose)
• Mixed strategy equilibrium

B: Heads    B: Tails
A: Heads  (3,3)      (-1,4)
A: Tails  (4,-1)     (2,2)

	(Heads, Heads): 5/9 * 5/9 = 25/81 ≈ 30.86%
(Heads, Tails): 5/9 * 4/9 = 20/81 ≈ 24.69%
(Tails, Heads): 4/9 * 5/9 = 20/81 ≈ 24.69%
(Tails, Tails): 4/9 * 4/9 = 16/81 ≈ 19.75%

# Betting Layer:
• Three spectators betting on the outcome
• Sealed bid auction format
• Repeated Game
• Randomly assigned house roles for dispute resolution

# Dispute Resolution:
• If layer 1 players disagree on the outcome
• Two of the three spectators validate the payout

# Spectator Roles: 
Instead of betting, the three spectators (X, Y, and Z) will collectively act as the house.
Their roles will be: 
a) Odds Setter: One spectator randomly chosen to set the odds for each outcome. 
b) Banker: One spectator randomly chosen to manage the payouts. 
c) Validator: One spectator left to act as a tie-breaker in case of disputes.

Banking: The Banker would need to have a pool of funds to cover potential payouts. This could be provided equally by all three spectators, or could be backed by an external source.
Validation: The Validator's role is crucial in case A and B disagree on the outcome. They would make the final call, which adds an interesting dynamic as they might be incentivized to rule in favor of the outcome that's most profitable for the house.
Incentives: To align incentives, the spectators could share in the profits (or losses) of the house. This would encourage the Odds Setter to set fair but profitable odds, the Banker to manage payouts correctly, and the Validator to make accurate judgments.
