# Synergy-Strategy-Algorithm

Purpose:
The game is designed to combine:
1.	Evolutionary game theory related to group foraging to reduce greed
2.	Evolutionary stable strategies to encourage positive betting behavior
3.	A non-zero sum game with no house edge
4.	A core that is totally unpredictable with incomplete information
5.	Time constraints agreed upon by the two core players
The game aims to benefit everyone while maintaining unpredictability and incomplete information.

Mathematical Proof for the Game:

π_i(x_i, X_{-i}) = μ(X)/n - c_i(x_i) + (1-exp(-α * ∑_i x_i)) * x_i * ∑_{j≠i} (x_j / σ_j^2) / (∑_{k≠i} 1/σ_k^2)
Var[π_i] = σ^2(X)/n^2

Updated payoff function 08/18/2024:
π_i(x_i, X_{-i}) = μ(X)/n - c_i(x_i) + (1-exp(-α * ∑_i x_i)) * x_i * ∑_{j≠i} (x_j / σ_j^2) / (∑_{k≠i} 1/σ_k^2) - β * (μ(X) - x_i)^2


π_i(xi, X{-i}): Payoff function for player i
xi: Strategy of player i 
X{-i}: Strategies of all players except i 
μ(X): Mean function of all strategies 
n: Number of players 
c_i(x_i): Cost function for player i 
α: A parameter to assess risk
σ_j: Standard deviation associated with player j

penalty_term(x_i, X) = β * (μ(X) - x_i)^2

β: Penalty coefficient
μ(X): Average bet of all players
x_i: Player i's bet

1.	Core Game:
•	Two players
•	50/50 chance outcome (like a coin flip)
•	2x2 payoff matrix
•	Non-zero sum (players can both gain or lose)
•	Mixed strategy equilibrium

B: Heads    B: Tails
A: Heads  (3,3)      (-1,4)
A: Tails  (4,-1)     (2,2)

	(Heads, Heads): 5/9 * 5/9 = 25/81 ≈ 30.86%
(Heads, Tails): 5/9 * 4/9 = 20/81 ≈ 24.69%
(Tails, Heads): 4/9 * 5/9 = 20/81 ≈ 24.69%
(Tails, Tails): 4/9 * 4/9 = 16/81 ≈ 19.75%


2.	Betting Layer:
•	Three spectators betting on the outcome
•	Sealed bid auction format
•	Repeated Game
• Randomly assigned house roles for dispute resolution


3.	Dispute Resolution:
•	If core players disagree on the outcome
•	Two of the three spectators validate the payout

4. Spectator Roles: Instead of betting, the three spectators (X, Y, and Z) will collectively act as the house.
Their roles will be: 
a) Odds Setter: One spectator randomly chosen to set the odds for each outcome. 
b) Banker: One spectator randomly chosen to manage the payouts. 
c) Validator: One spectator left to act as a tie-breaker in case of disputes.

Banking: The Banker would need to have a pool of funds to cover potential payouts. This could be provided equally by all three spectators, or could be backed by an external source.
Validation: The Validator's role is crucial in case A and B disagree on the outcome. They would make the final call, which adds an interesting dynamic as they might be incentivized to rule in favor of the outcome that's most profitable for the house.
Incentives: To align incentives, the spectators could share in the profits (or losses) of the house. This would encourage the Odds Setter to set fair but profitable odds, the Banker to manage payouts correctly, and the Validator to make accurate judgments.

5.	Information Structure:
•	Imperfect information
